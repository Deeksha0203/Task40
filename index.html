            <h3>What is a good speed for a computer?</h3>
            <p class="speed">A computer with a processing speed of 3.5 to 4 GHz is good, but users who game or run resource-intensive
                programs may require higher speeds. For RAM, 8 GB tends to be enough for most users.</p>

            <p class="speed">Laptops tend to slow down faster than desktops due to their design differences, largely impacted by size.

                background processes, malware infections, insufficient storage space, hardware issues like a <span
